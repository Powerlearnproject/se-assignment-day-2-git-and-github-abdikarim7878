## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Answer:Fundamental Concepts of Version Control  
Version control is a system that helps track changes in code over time, allowing developers to:  
✅ Manage different versions of files efficiently.  
✅ Collaborate seamlessly by merging contributions from multiple developers.  
✅ Revert to previous versions in case of errors or unexpected issues.  
✅ Maintain a history of changes for transparency and debugging.  

There are two main types of version control systems:  
1. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) – A single server stores all versions of code (e.g., SVN, Perforce).  
2. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) – Each developer has a full copy of the repository (e.g., Git, Mercurial).  

---

Why GitHub is a Popular Version Control Tool  
GitHub is a web-based platform that extends Git, providing features for collaborative software development. It is widely used because:  

🔹 Remote Repository Hosting – Developers can store, share, and access repositories from anywhere.  
🔹 Collaboration Features – Supports pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.  
🔹 Branching & Merging– Allows developers to work on separate features and merge them seamlessly.  
🔹 Continuous Integration (CI/CD) – Automates testing and deployment processes.  
🔹 Security & Access Control – Enables role-based permissions and private repositories.  
🔹 Open Source & Community – Hosts millions of open-source projects and encourages knowledge sharing.  

---

How Version Control Helps Maintain Project Integrity
✅ Prevents Code Loss – Every change is recorded, ensuring no progress is lost.  
✅ Tracks Changes & History – Developers can check who made what changes and when.  
✅ Facilitates Collaboration– Teams can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.  
✅ Supports Experimentation – Developers can create branches to test new features without affecting the main project.  
✅ Enables Easy Rollback – If an issue arises, it’s easy to revert to a previous stable version.
